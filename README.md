## General Info

Algorithm Visualizer is inspired by the numerous visual representations of algorithm that I discovered when learning about Data Structures and Algorithms. I wanted to create a web application that would allow me to delve into web development while refining my knowledge on DSAs.

A live demo can be found here: [Algorithm Visualizer](https://derek-le1105.github.io/algorithm-visualizers/)

This web application allows you to visualize certain algorithms that would otherwise be difficult to understand without a visual representation. Certain representations include various sorting, pathfinding, and search algorithms. Each module explores the different representations; one for sorting arrays, another for path-finding within a grid, and the last one for searching puzzle states.
